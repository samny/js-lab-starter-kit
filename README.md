## Usage

### Development

Run `npm start` in a terminal and direct your web browser to http://localhost:1234

### Distribution bundle

Run `npm run dist` in a terminal to build a distribution bundle that outputs to the `dist` directory.

## Home screen app

The project is set up to work as a standalone app when saved to your mobile phones homescreen. To make it look nice you should update the icons and splash screens, follow the instructions in the [PWA icons and splash repo](https://github.com/samny/pwa-icons-and-splash).
